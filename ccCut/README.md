## Overview
Implementing John Crickett's [Coding Challenge #2 - Build Your Own cut Tool!](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cut)

## Steps
* [x] Step 0: Project setup and download the [test](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hpbma5alue0du34/challenge-cut.zip?e=1&dl=0) folder
* [x] Step 1:Implement a simple version of cut that will open the provided tab separated file and print out the second field (-f2) from each line
* [x] Step 2: Extend your code to support the -d option
* [x] Step 3: Add support for the -f option
* [] Step 4: Support reading from the standard input stream if no filename is provided or if the single dash is provided ‘-’
* [] Step 5: Revisit the first coding challenge and use our [ccwc tool](https://github.com/insignias/codingchallenges/tree/main/ccwc) combining it with our new cut tool to build a simple command line data engineering pipeline
